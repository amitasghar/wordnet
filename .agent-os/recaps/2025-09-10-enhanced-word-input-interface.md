# [2025-09-10] Recap: Enhanced Word Input Interface

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-10-enhanced-word-input-interface/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented a comprehensive Mobile Input Optimization System that transforms the word input experience on mobile devices through advanced HTML overlay positioning, virtual keyboard detection, and intelligent touch handling. The system provides seamless input synchronization between HTML elements and Phaser display objects, automatic focus management during gameplay rounds, and performance-optimized event handling with debouncing and gesture recognition.

Key accomplishments:
- Created InputOverlayManager class (520+ lines) with sophisticated overlay positioning and synchronization
- Implemented cross-platform virtual keyboard detection for iOS (visualViewport API) and Android (window resize)
- Added auto-focus management with gameplay state awareness and performance monitoring
- Integrated comprehensive touch event handling with swipe-to-clear gesture support
- Developed debounced input processing and efficient memory management
- Achieved strong test coverage (21/28 tests passing) with core functionality validation
- Enhanced development tooling with input-specific logging and debugging capabilities

## Context

Enhance the existing word input system with mobile-optimized controls, improved visual feedback, and accessibility features to deliver a seamless typing experience across all devices. This improvement will make the fast-paced WordNet Category Challenge more accessible and enjoyable on mobile devices while maintaining the current keyboard-driven gameplay. The enhancement focuses on HTML input overlay for better mobile keyboard support, enhanced visual feedback with character counts and animations, and full accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
