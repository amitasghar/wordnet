> Spec: Enhanced Word Input Interface
> Created: 2025-09-10

## Overview

Enhance the existing word input system with mobile-optimized controls, improved visual feedback, and accessibility features to deliver a seamless typing experience across all devices. This improvement will make the fast-paced WordNet Category Challenge more accessible and enjoyable on mobile devices while maintaining the current keyboard-driven gameplay.

## User Stories

### Mobile Player Experience Enhancement

As a mobile player, I want to easily input words using my device's virtual keyboard, so that I can enjoy the same fast-paced gameplay experience as desktop users without struggling with input responsiveness or accuracy.

The enhanced interface will feature a larger, touch-friendly input area that automatically focuses when the game round starts, properly handles virtual keyboard display, and provides clear visual feedback for successful word submissions. Mobile players will no longer experience input lag or miss submissions due to small touch targets.

### Improved Visual Feedback for All Users

As a player on any device, I want clear and immediate visual feedback when typing and submitting words, so that I can quickly understand my input status and maintain focus during the fast-paced game rounds.

The system will provide real-time character count indicators, enhanced success/error animations, and optional autocomplete suggestions. Players will see immediate confirmation of word acceptance or rejection, helping them maintain rhythm during the timed challenges.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

As a player with accessibility needs, I want keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility, so that I can participate in the word categorization challenge regardless of my input method or assistive technology requirements.

The enhanced interface will support full keyboard navigation, provide semantic HTML structure for screen readers, and include high contrast mode support for users with visual impairments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mobile Input Optimization** - Implement HTML input overlay system with proper virtual keyboard handling and auto-focus management for mobile devices.

5. **Performance Improvements** - Optimize input responsiveness, reduce input lag, and maintain 60 FPS during intensive typing sessions.

## Out of Scope

## Expected Deliverable

1. Mobile players can input words as quickly and accurately as desktop users, with proper virtual keyboard support and responsive touch targets.

2. All users experience enhanced visual feedback including character counts, typing indicators, and smooth success/error animations.

3. Players using assistive technologies can fully participate in the game with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
