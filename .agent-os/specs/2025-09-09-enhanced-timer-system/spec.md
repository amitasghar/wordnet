> Spec: Enhanced Timer System
> Created: 2025-09-09

## Overview

Implement an enhanced timer system with configurable durations (60-90 seconds), visual countdown indicators, and progressive warning alerts to support the fast-paced gameplay mechanics of Category Challenge. This system will integrate with existing GameLoopManager and GameStateManager to provide precise timing, visual feedback, and seamless pause/resume functionality.

## User Stories

### Fast-Paced Gaming Experience

As a casual mobile gamer, I want to see a clear countdown timer with visual warnings, so that I can manage my time effectively during intense 60-90 second word categorization rounds.

The timer displays remaining time prominently with color-coded warnings (green > yellow at 30s > red at 10s) and pulsing animations during critical moments. Users receive clear visual cues about time remaining without disrupting their focus on gameplay.

### Configurable Round Duration

As a word puzzle enthusiast, I want different round durations based on difficulty, so that I can experience varied challenge levels from quick 60-second sprints to more thoughtful 90-second rounds.

The system supports configurable timer durations per round type, allowing for different gameplay experiences while maintaining the core fast-paced nature of the game.

### Seamless Pause/Resume

As a commuter playing during breaks, I want the timer to pause automatically when I switch browser tabs or manually pause the game, so that I don't lose progress due to interruptions.

The timer integrates with existing pause/resume functionality and handles browser visibility changes gracefully, preserving the game state when players need to step away.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Visual Timer Display** - Prominent countdown with color-coded warnings and smooth transitions
2. **Configurable Duration System** - Support for 60-90 second rounds with per-round configuration
3. **Progressive Warning System** - Visual alerts at 30s, 15s, 10s, and 5s remaining with increasing urgency
4. **GameLoop Integration** - Seamless integration with existing GameLoopManager for precise timing
5. **Pause/Resume Support** - Automatic and manual pause handling with state preservation

## Out of Scope

- Audio system implementation (will be addressed in future audio feature spec)
- Timer customization UI for end users (admin/config only)
- Cross-session timer persistence (timers reset between game sessions)
- Multiple concurrent timers (single timer per game round)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced timer display that shows countdown with color transitions and warning animations during active gameplay
2. Configurable timer system that supports different round durations (60-90 seconds) based on game configuration
3. Seamless integration with existing pause/resume functionality that preserves timer state during game interruptions
