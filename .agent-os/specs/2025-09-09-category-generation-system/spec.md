> Spec: Category and Letter Generation System
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a random category/letter combination generation system for 60-90 second game rounds in Category Challenge. The system will provide dynamic, varied gameplay by generating appropriate category and letter pairings that maintain engagement while ensuring fair difficulty distribution across rounds.

## User Stories

- **As a player**, I want to start new rounds quickly so that I can maintain game flow and momentum
- **As a player**, I want variety in category/letter combinations so that each game feels fresh and challenging
- **As a player**, I want appropriate difficulty levels so that rounds are challenging but achievable within the time limit
- **As a player**, I want consistent game performance so that round generation doesn't interrupt gameplay
- **As a developer**, I want a flexible system so that I can easily add new categories and adjust difficulty balancing

## Spec Scope

- Category database with metadata and difficulty ratings
- Letter generation algorithms with frequency-based distribution
- Combination logic that pairs categories with appropriate letters
- Difficulty balancing system to ensure fair challenge progression
- Integration with existing game systems (WordDataManager, game flow)
- Performance optimization for quick round initialization
- Data validation and fallback systems for robust operation
- Round configuration and state management
- Allow developer to add/remove categories

## Out of Scope

- User-generated categories and custom category creation
- Multiplayer category synchronization and shared experiences
- Advanced AI-based category suggestions or adaptive difficulty
- Category localization and multi-language support
- Historical analytics and performance tracking beyond basic metrics

## Expected Deliverable

A complete Category and Letter Generation System that generates valid category/letter combinations, integrates seamlessly with existing game flow, and provides appropriate challenge variety. The system should support fast round starts (under 100ms generation time), maintain data consistency, and enhance the core 60-90 second gameplay experience with engaging variety.
