# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-enhanced-timer-system/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### TimerManager Implementation
- Create new `TimerManager.js` class following existing manager pattern architecture
- Integrate with `GameLoopManager` for frame-based timing precision (60 FPS updates)
- Support configurable duration via `GameStateManager.roundConfig.timeLimit` property
- Implement event emission system for timer state changes: `timer:warning`, `timer:critical`, `timer:expired`
- Handle pause/resume state by respecting `GameLoopManager.isPaused` flag

### Visual Display System
- Enhance existing `GameScene.updateTimer()` method with progressive color transitions
- Implement color scheme: Green (>30s) → Yellow (30-10s) → Red (<10s)
- Add pulsing animation for critical time periods (<10s remaining)
- Create circular progress indicator component overlaying countdown text
- Maintain 1-second display precision for user clarity while using sub-second internal precision

### Game Integration Points
- Extend `GameStateManager` to include timer configuration per round type
- Hook timer events into existing scene transition system in `SceneManager`
- Integrate with current error handling patterns using `devTools.js` logging
- Support browser visibility API for automatic pause on tab switching
- Maintain compatibility with existing hot reload development workflow

### Performance Requirements
- Target 60 FPS performance with negligible timer overhead (<1ms per frame)
- Implement delta time accumulation for consistent timing across frame rate variations
- Use requestAnimationFrame-based timing through existing GameLoopManager infrastructure
- Handle low-performance scenarios with graceful timing degradation
- Ensure timer accuracy within ±100ms over full 90-second duration

### State Management
- Preserve timer state during pause/resume operations
- Reset timer state on round transitions via existing GameStateManager events
- Persist timer warnings state to prevent duplicate alert triggers
- Maintain timer configuration in game session storage for consistency
