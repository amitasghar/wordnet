> Spec: Phaser Game Engine Setup
> Created: 2025-09-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This specification establishes the foundational Phaser.js game engine infrastructure for a fast-paced word game, including comprehensive setup for initialization, scene management, and asset loading. The implementation will create a robust technical foundation that supports responsive gameplay and efficient resource management.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want a properly configured Phaser.js game engine so that I can build game features on a solid technical foundation without worrying about basic setup issues.

**As a developer**, I want integrated scene management and asset loading capabilities so that I can efficiently organize game states and resources for optimal performance.

**As a player**, I want the game to load quickly and display properly across different devices so that I can start playing immediately without technical barriers.

## Spec Scope

1. **Phaser.js initialization and configuration** - Core engine setup with proper game configuration, canvas creation, and physics system preparation
2. **Core game loop structure and scene management** - Scene system implementation with preload, create, and update lifecycle management
3. **Basic asset loading capabilities** - Asset preloader with support for images, fonts, and audio files with loading progress feedback
4. **TailwindCSS integration points** - Seamless integration between Phaser canvas and TailwindCSS UI elements for consistent styling
5. **Vite development environment setup** - Hot reload configuration, build optimization, and development server setup for efficient development workflow
6. **Canvas responsive design system** - Dynamic canvas resizing and scaling system that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
7. **Storage preparation (LocalStorage/IndexedDB)** - Data persistence infrastructure setup for game state, user preferences, and progress tracking

## Out of Scope

- Actual game mechanics implementation (word generation, validation, scoring)
- Specific word database integration and validation logic
- User interface components and menu systems
- Audio system implementation and sound effects
- Multiplayer functionality and networking
- Advanced visual effects and animations
- Game balancing and difficulty progression
- User account management and authentication

## Expected Deliverable

**Browser-testable Phaser.js application** that displays a functional game canvas with scene management, loads and displays basic placeholder assets, and demonstrates responsive scaling across different viewport sizes.

**Integrated development environment** with Vite hot reload, TailwindCSS compilation, and proper asset pipeline that allows for efficient development workflow.

**Storage system foundation** with working LocalStorage/IndexedDB integration that can persist and retrieve basic game data for future feature development.
