# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-category-generation-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-09
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Category Data Structure and Storage
- Category objects with ID, name, description, difficulty rating (1-5), and metadata
- JSON-based category database with lazy loading capabilities
- Category grouping by theme and difficulty for balanced selection
- Validation rules for category definitions and letter compatibility

### Letter Generation Algorithms
- Weighted random selection based on letter frequency in English
- Difficulty adjustment factors for vowels vs consonants
- Exclusion logic for impossible category/letter combinations
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases and data unavailability

### Integration with Existing WordDataManager
- Extend WordDataManager class with CategoryLetterGenerator module
- Maintain compatibility with existing word validation systems
- Share data structures and caching mechanisms where appropriate
- Preserve existing performance characteristics and memory usage

### Performance Requirements
- Category/letter generation under 100ms for round initialization
- Memory-efficient category storage with minimal RAM footprint
- Lazy loading of category data to reduce startup time
- Optimized algorithms for real-time generation during gameplay

### Data Validation and Fallback Systems
- Input validation for all category and letter data
- Graceful degradation when categories are unavailable
- Default category sets as fallback options
- Error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring

## Approach

### Architecture Design
- Modular design with CategoryManager and LetterGenerator classes
- Observer pattern for game state integration
- Dependency injection for testing and flexibility
- Clean separation between data, logic, and presentation layers

### Implementation Strategy
- Phase 1: Core data structures and basic generation
- Phase 2: Integration with WordDataManager and game flow
- Phase 3: Performance optimization and advanced features
- Phase 4: Testing, validation, and polish

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for generation algorithms and data validation
- Integration tests with WordDataManager and game systems
- Performance benchmarks for generation speed requirements
- User experience testing for difficulty balance and variety

## External Dependencies

### Data Sources
- Category definitions database (JSON format)
- Letter frequency tables for English language
- Difficulty calibration data from user testing

### Integration Points
- WordDataManager class for data consistency
- Game state management for round initialization
- UI components for category/letter display
- Performance monitoring and analytics systems
